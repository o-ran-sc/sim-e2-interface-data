# Demo dataset (c) VIAVI Solutions 2020

The data set generated by VIAVI RAN simulator/RIC tester models an urban
environment with 12 cells and 21 pedestrians scattered around.

Each pedestrians has 0.2Gbps traffic throughput demand. Cell-1 is saturated
with 4 pedestrians. A car “Car-1” travels from cell 1 towards cell 8 at 20m/s. 

In order to maximize the Car-1 throughput as the optimisation policy target,
the RIC triggers a handover of Car-1 from cell 1 to neighbour uncongested cells
as it is leaving Cell-1. The urban environment is emulated with the VIAVI
mobility model, channel propagation model and traffic shaping and scheduling
model.
